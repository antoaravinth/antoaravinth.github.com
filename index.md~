## HI ALL. 


### About me:
Nothing much about me. I'm a guy who have just finished my Engineering (B.E) and working as an intern in [Juspay](http://juspay.in/).
I certainly love doing some stuffs with programming languages like Java, Groovy , C#. Recently fallen in love with bash scripting. 
Love to solve programatic problems. Always eager to learn new things in current software field. Ah! Thats much enough about me.


###About this blog:
I will be trying to blog on what I seems to be very interesting. Probably I will cover some of the nice techniques and inner workings of
certain languages in my posts. After its a blog on what I love and what I hunger for! Apart from it this blog runs on Jekyll.
