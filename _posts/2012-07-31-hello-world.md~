###Conventions used in this blog.
Hello all, this is my new blog. I shifted from (here)[http://cse0812.blogspot.in/]. There are many reason's for it.
The first and last reason is that I can't add code snippets easily in blogspot (I need to prefer some other tips/tricks), which I hate completely. 

This blogs run on Jekyll, which is built on ruby I guess, not sure though. 

So I will follow certain conventions in this blog.

I will represent code snippets something like:
	

	System.out.println("something");
	//why I need this ;??
	int a = 10;
	
And I will represent the variable used in the code snippets using this way `a`. So `a` refers to `int` of value `10`. 
So what I basically want you people to keep in mind is that `a` is not equal to *a*.

And I'm very new to Jekyll, I'm trying to figure out how it is working. So the blog haven't completed fully. Sorry for that.

That's it. This will be the convention I will be using. Fine you can find all posts on Archieve link on the nav tab.

###That's all folks
