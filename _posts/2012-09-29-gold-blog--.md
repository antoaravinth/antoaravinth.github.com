Hello everyone hope your enjoying your week end and hope that you people are doing great. 

Gold rates are been increasing over the years ( or more accurate over the **days** ). Who cares about it? Definitely not me, 
but someone will do!

That someone will be mostly *girls*. I don't know what make them to be more craze about it ( if you know, share that secret with me ). As every women interested to know the rate of *today's gold rate*, my mom too fall into that category. 

When I been doing something on my PC; my mom will enter and ask "You know what is the rate of today's gold, my son". 
Ah! I'm not interested in knowing those. Ok, anyway, I will go to [this](http://rates.goldenchennai.com/) for checking the rate. Once I said the rate to my mom, my mom's next words will be "Do you know how much the rate was yesterday?". Woof! Thats even harder question than the first one. . . I will search in net and say her. Story ended.

###The END!!!

But unfortunately this story never ends but either it *repeats* every day. It's something like:

	while(true)
	{
		//I will be asking the rate daily my son
	}

You know what, doing this routine process daily is worst. So I built a small script that does exactly what my mom or other girls would want. 

I want something like this: There should be a program, which when I run it goes to [this](http://rates.goldenchennai.com/) site and checks for the rate and save the rate somewhere. Saving the rate somewhere is the answer for my mom's second question ( see para 4). This way of thinking is called as [wishful thinking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking). I wish this should be there, but in reality it isn't. 


Building such a script is easy task to do. But when it is come to handling webpages its not that much easy. Ok lets see what I did exactly. Before seeing the code of it, lets think for the moment. The [site](http://rates.goldenchennai.com/) has the gold rate displayed in left hand side of the page. If you look into the source code of it, you can see the rate that is been displayed is wrapped up within this element :

	<td width="63%" class="yellowTxt">

The whole point is to do this:

+ Go and hit the site
+ Search for the element `<td width="63%" class="yellowTxt">`
+ Once I get the rate, do with it what ever you want to do.

So our wishful thinking has got some improvement on it. If your into web development or did create some web pages then you know the second point of the algorithm is very hard to do manually. That is getting the contents out of the tag: 

	<td width="63%" class="yellowTxt">

is pretty hard. Luckily we have a 3-rd party lib named [jsoup](jsoup.org/). Jsoup is very much close to jquery which is available for the JVM platform. You need to add the jar to your classpath to make use of the Jsoup for your project. 

First things first. To get the details from the webpage you need to open up the page first, this is done via :

	def url = "http://rates.goldenchennai.com/";
	def document = Jsoup.connect(url).get();

The `connect` method will connect to `http://rates.goldenchennai.com/` this url and get the contents via `get`. This is what the above line does. 

Having connected to the page we need to search the page which we have in `document` for the finding the gold rate. Before I show up the code for you, the displaying of gold rate in that site is built using: 

	<td width="63%" class="yellowTxt">
		<span title="Chennai 22 Carat 1 gm Gold Rate">22 Carat 1 gm</span>
	</td>
	<td width="37%" class="yellowTxt" align="left"><b>
	<span title="Chennai 22 Carat 1 gm Gold Price">2,961.00</span></b>
	</td>

This is where I can show you the nice beauty of Jsoup. In this case I need to get the content `22 Carat 1 gm`. Having `document` in hand, we can search for the `class` named `yellowTxt` in Jsoup using `select` method like this:

	def goldDetails = document.select(".yellowTxt")

Now `goldDetails` have 8 `td` tag in it, which means it matches with eight `yellowTxt`. If this is confusing to you, look at the site, it has 4 rows for 22 Carat 1 gm, 24 Carat 1 gm, 22 Carat 1 Sovergn, 24 Carat 1 Sovergn and 4 rows for there prices respectively. These four contents along with their price are listed out using `td` tags. If you look at the `goldDetails` in debugger its what it will look like:

	[<td width="63%" class="yellowTxt"><span title="Chennai 22 Carat 1 gm Gold Rate">22 Carat 1 gm</span></td> , <td width="37%" class="yellowTxt" align="left"><b><span title="Chennai 22 Carat 1 gm Gold Price"><img src="http://rates.goldenchennai.com/css/img/rs.png" />2,961.00</span></b></td> . . . . . . ]

Look at this *list* for a moment, there are two elements in it (note the `,`). I displayed only two elements here, actually it has 8 elements. But we are interested only in two elements. Meaning I need the details of `22 Carat 1 gm` alone, not others. 

With the help of `first()` method we can get the contents of the first element in `goldDetails`. Again the first element in `goldDetails` will be: 


	<span title="Chennai 22 Carat 1 gm Gold Rate">22 Carat 1 gm</span>


But what we want here is the text of `span`, luckily we have `text` method, so doing so :

	def caratDetails = goldDetails.first().text()

will result in `caratDetails` as `22 Carat 1 gm`. Still with me? If so thats great :)

Now we need to get the price of the gold which is what really matters. The price will be in the second `td` tag, again we have this details in `goldDetails`. This time we need the second `td` tag not the first one, so we have to use `get` method here. Since the `goldDetails` is somewhat array in nature, you need to hit the index `1` to get the second element. So doing so :

	def goldRate = goldDetails.get(1).text()

will get the price of the gold, which is  `2,961.00`. 

The hardest part of my mom's first need is done. Second part is easy, where I need to find the gold rate of yesterday. Since I run this script everyday, I will store the result of the price in a file, so when I run next day I will just open that file and print it ( which will be the yesterday's price ). So the whole code is : 

		@Grab('org.jsoup:jsoup:1.6.3')
		import org.jsoup.Jsoup;
		import org.jsoup.nodes.Document;
		import org.jsoup.nodes.Element;
		import org.jsoup.select.Elements;
		def oldRate;
		//print the old Rate
		new File("fileCreater").each {
			oldRate = it
		}
		println "Old gold rate is ${oldRate}"
		def url = "http://rates.goldenchennai.com/";
		def document = Jsoup.connect(url).get();
		def goldDetails = document.select(".yellowTxt")
		def caratDetails= goldDetails.first().text()
		def goldRate = goldDetails.get(1).text()
		println "WebScraping with Groovy \n"
		println "Today's Gold Rate (in Chennai/India)"
		println """
		|------------------|--------------|
		| Name             |    Rate      |
		|                  |              |
		|  ${caratDetails}      ${goldRate}    |
		|------------------|--------------|
		"""
		println "Thanks to Groovy and Jsoup"

		//put the rate into a file. . . . 
		new File("fileCreater").withWriter { out ->
		      out.println goldRate
		}


The output will be :

	Old gold rate is 2,961.00
	WebScraping with Groovy 
	Today's Gold Rate (in Chennai/India)
	|------------------|--------------|
	| Name             |    Rate      |
	|                  |              |
	|  22 Carat 1 gm      2,961.00    |
	|------------------|--------------|
	Thanks to Groovy and Jsoup

Now I can say :


	while(true)
	{
		//I will be asking the rate daily my son
		//No worries mom, I have a ready-made script for you :D :D 
	}

That is it, story ended. 

###The END!!!

Apart from it, if you think the code is very hard ( eventhough its easy ), I have another solution for you. If you run Ubuntu on your systems, you can simply do : 

	curl http://rates.goldenchennai.com/ | grep "Chennai 22 Carat 1 gm Gold Price"

which will output:

	<td width="37%" class="yellowTxt" align="left"><b><span title="Chennai 22 Carat 1 gm Gold Price"><img src="http://rates.goldenchennai.com/css/img/rs.png"> 2,961.00</span></b></td>

Oki, the output doesn't look great, but you can see the rate is `2,961.00`. But that doesn't answers my mom's second question. But we can make them to do so. I wont say that here.

And finally the process of fetching details from the web page via a program is called as [Web Scraping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping). 

I just simply wrote this blog post in a text editor(gedit). So there can be splling mistke, may would has gramatical flaws badly. If that is the case leave a comment.

Thanks for reading my post. If you have any doubts, feel free to post the comment. Comments are welcome! Suggestions welcome. 


###That's all folks!
