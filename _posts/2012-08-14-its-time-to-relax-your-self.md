Hi all, this is my second blog post. I hope you know the conventions used in my blog, if not you can always read it from
[here](http://antoaravinth.github.com/2012/07/31/hello-world/). So apart from it, I will use this convention: <kbd>Del</kbd>. 
Means a delete key in your keyboard.

In this blog post I will explain you how do I relax myself with the help of Ubuntu.

Oki I need to finish up writing this blog post in half an hour(the reason of it, will be clear at end of this post).

Its rare to see me sitting idle. I will be in online most of the time, FB, Googling and doing other stuff that keeps me going. I'm a guy who can maximum concentrate on a single subject at most half an hour. Say I'm reading Physics, I can fully concentrate on Physics only for half an hour and after that I can't. I need some refrehsing after that-- something like hearing to song.

One of my favourite songs out this in year is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er3epSUp6UE). 

So after reading Physics for half an hour, I want to hear this song. Oki that doesn't seem to be very intersting! Right? I can go to the song location and double click and hear to it. Ah! More work is needed. I was thinking how to *automate* this process.That is, somehow I say to my system that, after half an hour of time (from my work being started i.e reading Physics in this case) go and play this particular song. And that's what exactly I'm going to explain in remaining post. 

Alright! Again, if this doesn't seems interesting to you, you can skip reading my post. 

Came here? Interested reading? Cool. Lets start. So there are plenty of ways to automate this process. For example, I can write a java program which starts a thread and sleeps for half hour and goes to the music location and plays it with the help of [music api](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/sound/sampled/package-summary.html).
